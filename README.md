# MetastaticBottleneck
Metastasis formation model and data processing code
This project consists of three functional parts:
1) Code for processing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data, extracting information about the dependence of clinical variables on tumor diameter.
2) Code with our metastasis formation model and fitting the model to data
3) Code for summarizing and visualizing the fits, validation and estimated model parameters.
